Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, then game is over.

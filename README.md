Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, then game is over. Our website built using html5, css3, Javascript and jQuery Library depicts similar game where user need to remember the pattern and click on it accordingly. Once, the wrong pattern is selected, game will get over and will ask to restart on keypress.
